## Introduction
The CIFAR-10 (Canadian Institute for Advanced Research) is a widely used dataset for learning image classification. This dataset was developed by CIFAR (Canadian Institute for Advanced Research) and it has 60, 000 32X32 colour image which are divided into 10 classes. CIFAR has 50,000 training images and 10,000 test images. These classes include airplanes, cars, birds, cats, deer, dogs, frogs, horses, ships, and trucks. The dataset has 10 classes that is why it is called CIFAR-10. Each class in CIFAR-10 has 60,000 32X32 colour images. The dataset is already solved but it is still widely used in machine learning algorithms for classification of objects. The images in CIFAR are very low resolution. This dataset is widely used with convolutional neural networks for recognizing images in CIFAR.

## Confusion Matrix for model one 
It shows how classified and unclassified images. So the accuracy of CNN is very satisfactory.
